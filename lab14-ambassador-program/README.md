## 🧩 Lab Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Design the Ambassador Program Structure
Created structured documentation defining:
- Program goals
- Selection criteria
- Roles and responsibilities
- Program operational flow

### Task 2: Create Assessment Surveys
Built a structured survey system including:
- JSON-based survey questions
- Deployment guide and communication template

### Task 3: Analyze Survey Data with Python
Implemented survey analysis automation to:
- Generate sample responses
- Score candidates using weighted criteria
- Produce plots and structured reports
- Track ambassador program activities and engagement metrics

### Task 4: Develop Training Materials
Created ambassador curriculum + resources including:
- Training modules (culture, communication, content, management)
- Templates and guides for campaigns and activities
- Assessment question bank for training validation

### Task 5: Establish Program Metrics
Defined measurable KPIs and delivered reporting assets:
- Participation, reach, engagement, impact metrics
- Quarterly report template
- Dashboard automation and executive summary generator

---

## 📌 Key Deliverables Produced
- Program framework + role documentation
- Survey templates (JSON) + deployment guide
- Python-based survey analyzer (reports + plots)
- Program activity tracker (dashboard + exports)
- KPI dashboard generator + executive summary
- Ambassador training curriculum + resources + assessment
- Reporting metrics documentation + quarterly template

---

## ✅ What I Learned
- How to structure a scalable ambassador program across departments
- How to use survey design to identify high-potential candidates
- How to build Python tooling for scoring, tracking, and reporting
- How to translate qualitative culture goals into measurable KPIs
- How to build reusable templates for training and quarterly reporting

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters
Security teams can’t scale culture change alone. Ambassador programs extend security influence through trusted peers in each department, improving adoption of secure behaviors and increasing engagement.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Applications
- Creating a security champion network in medium/large organizations
- Running department-level awareness initiatives continuously
- Improving reporting culture and reducing risky behavior trends
- Producing executive-ready program performance reports

---

## ✅ Results
This lab resulted in a complete ambassador program toolkit:
- Candidate identification system
- Activity tracking + metrics dashboards
- Training curriculum + assessment system
- KPI framework + reporting templates

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This lab demonstrates a full lifecycle approach for building and operating a cybersecurity ambassador program—from candidate discovery to training and metrics measurement—creating a foundation for sustainable security culture improvement.
