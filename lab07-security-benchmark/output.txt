# Security Program Benchmark Assessment Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-19T12:11:04.318475

## Organization Information
- Name: **TechCorp Inc**
- Industry: **Technology**
- Assessment Date: **2024-01-15**

## Executive Summary
- Overall Score: **63.90%**
- Maturity Level: **2 - Developing - Basic processes**

## Domain Scores

| Domain | Score (%) |
|---|---:|
| governance | 72.00 |
| risk_management | 50.00 |
| incident_response | 52.00 |
| awareness | 74.00 |
| technical_controls | 68.00 |

## Recommendations
- [risk_management] Formalize risk assessment cadence and risk treatment tracking (gap 50.0%).
- [incident_response] Update IR plan, run tabletop exercises, and define IR roles (gap 48.0%).

## Notes
- Scores are computed from weighted questions (1-5) normalized to percentages.
- Overall score is weighted by domain importance from the framework config.
