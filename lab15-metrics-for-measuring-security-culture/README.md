# 🧪 Lab 15: Metrics for Measuring Security Culture

## 🎯 Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Design and implement a security culture measurement framework
- Collect and analyze security awareness metrics using Python
- Create interactive visualizations with D3.js for culture data
- Generate actionable insights from security behavior patterns
- Build a web-based dashboard for monitoring security culture

---

## ✅ Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming skills
- Understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with cybersecurity concepts
- Basic SQL knowledge
- Linux command line experience

---

## 🧰 Lab Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Cloud Lab Environment)
- User: `toor`
- Tools Used:
  - Python 3 + venv
  - SQLite3
  - Flask
  - Pandas / NumPy
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn
  - D3.js (frontend visualization)

---

## 🧩 Lab Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Database Setup and Data Collection Framework
You create a structured project directory, initialize an SQLite database schema for storing culture metrics, and generate realistic sample data for testing.

### Task 2: Data Collection and Analysis Modules (Python)
You build reusable Python modules to collect metrics from the database, compute key culture indicators (training scores, phishing resilience, survey-based culture scores), and generate JSON-based reports.

### Task 3: Web Dashboard with D3.js Visualizations
You build a Flask web dashboard and connect it with D3.js charts to visualize culture KPIs, trends, and department comparisons using live API endpoints.

### Task 4: Analysis and Reporting
You generate comprehensive reports, interpret trends, and translate results into concrete action items for improving security culture.

## 📌 Key Deliverables
- SQLite database schema for culture metrics
- Sample data generator for realistic test datasets
- Python analyzers:
  - culture metrics report generator
  - trend report generator
- Flask dashboard application with API endpoints
- D3.js interactive visualization layer
- Culture reports saved as JSON

---

## ✅ Results Summary (High-Level)
This lab outputs a working measurement system capable of:
- Tracking security training effectiveness
- Measuring phishing simulation resilience (click + report rates)
- Quantifying culture through survey-based scoring
- Monitoring incident patterns and severity
- Visualizing trends and department differences via dashboard

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters (Real-World Relevance)
Security awareness is not “one-and-done.” Organizations need evidence of behavior change.
This lab mirrors real-world governance approaches where security leaders must:
- prove training impact
- detect risky behavior trends
- identify weak departments
- justify program improvements using metrics

---

## 🧠 What You Learned
- How to model security culture metrics in a database
- How to calculate culture indicators from multiple sources
- How to convert technical metrics into decision-friendly dashboards
- How to use APIs + D3.js for interactive monitoring
- How trend analysis reveals long-term program effectiveness

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how to build a complete security culture measurement platform: storing culture metrics in a database, analyzing patterns with Python, and visualizing results using a web dashboard. This framework supports continuous monitoring and helps teams take proactive action based on measurable security behavior.
