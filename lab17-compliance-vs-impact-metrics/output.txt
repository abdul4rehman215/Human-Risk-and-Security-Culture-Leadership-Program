COMPLIANCE METRICS vs IMPACT METRICS (SECURITY CULTURE PROGRAMS)
========================================================================

COMPLIANCE METRICS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition: Measures adherence to policies and training requirements
Examples:
  - Training completion rates
  - Policy acknowledgment percentages
  - Phishing simulation click rates
  - Assessment scores

IMPACT METRICS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition: Measures behavioral change and culture improvement
Examples:
  - Voluntary incident reporting increases
  - Proactive security behaviors
  - Peer-to-peer coaching instances
  - Security-conscious decision making

KEY DIFFERENCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What it measures:
   - Compliance: Completion / adherence (what people DID).
   - Impact: Behavior + culture change (how people CHANGED).
2) How it is used:
   - Compliance: Proves obligations were met (audits, governance).
   - Impact: Proves risk reduced and culture improved (strategy, ROI).
3) Risk interpretation:
   - High compliance can still produce low impact.
   - High impact usually requires some compliance but goes beyond it.

========================================================================
INTEGRATED: CORRELATION ANALYSIS (Compliance vs Impact)
========================================================================
Correlation: compliance_score vs culture_maturity_score = 0.421
Correlation: training_completion_rate vs voluntary_incident_reports = 0.287
Correlation: phishing_click_rate vs security_incidents = 0.346

Interpretation Guide:
- Correlation near +1: strong positive relationship
- Correlation near  0: weak/no linear relationship
- Correlation near -1: strong negative relationship

Expected security interpretation:
- Higher compliance_score should correlate with higher culture maturity (positive).
- Higher completion may correlate with more voluntary reporting (positive).
- Higher phishing_click_rate may correlate with higher incidents (positive).

========================================================================
INTEGRATED: STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================================================
- Sales: Highest phishing click rate -> run targeted phishing simulations + short weekly micro-lessons.
- Operations: Highest phishing click rate -> run targeted phishing simulations + short weekly micro-lessons.
- Sales: Higher incident rate -> run tabletop drills + simplify incident reporting + rapid feedback loops.
- Operations: Higher incident rate -> run tabletop drills + simplify incident reporting + rapid feedback loops.
- Program-level: Track BOTH compliance (completion) and impact (behavior, incidents) monthly. Do not treat compliance as success by itself.
- Program-level: Publish a quarterly culture scorecard: maturity trend, proactive behaviors, incident trend, and top improvement actions.

Top ROI Priority Departments (highest risk_priority):
- Sales (risk_priority=27.98)
- Operations (risk_priority=25.83)
- Finance (risk_priority=20.66)
