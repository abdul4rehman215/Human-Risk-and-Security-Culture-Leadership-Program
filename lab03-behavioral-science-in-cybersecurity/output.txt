CYBERSECURITY RISK PRIORITIZATION REPORT
=============================================

Executive Summary
------------------
Total Risks Assessed: 2
Critical Risks: 0
High Risks: 1
Medium Risks: 0
Low Risks: 1

Risk ID: RISK-001
Risk Name: Phishing Email Attacks
Priority Level: High
Priority Score: 63.36
Impact Score: 8.5
Threat Frequency: 9.0
Affected Users: 2
Recommendations:
 - Increase motivation: run targeted awareness campaigns and leadership messaging for this risk.
 - Increase ability: provide hands-on training, clear SOPs, and simplify security tools/workflows.
 - Increase triggers: enable reminders, banners, simulations, and just-in-time prompts for users.
 - High impact detected: apply stronger controls, monitoring, and escalation procedures.
 - High frequency detected: prioritize continuous controls and frequent user testing/simulations.
---------------------------------------------
Risk ID: RISK-002
Risk Name: Unauthorized Software Installation
Priority Level: Low
Priority Score: 3.58
Impact Score: 6.5
Threat Frequency: 5.0
Affected Users: 2
Recommendations:
 - Maintain current controls and perform periodic reassessment to ensure risk stays controlled.
---------------------------------------------

✔ Higher priority assigned to weak-behavior users
✔ Sorting works correctly
✔ Recommendations generated
