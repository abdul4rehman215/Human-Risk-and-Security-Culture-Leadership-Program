# 🧪 Lab 13: Data-Driven Behavior Change

## 🎯 Lab Overview

This lab focuses on designing and implementing a **data-driven cybersecurity behavior tracking system**. Instead of relying on assumptions or anecdotal feedback, this lab demonstrates how to systematically measure, analyze, and improve employee security behavior using structured data, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques.

The lab integrates:

- Behavior tracking datasets
- Automated data generation
- Statistical analysis using Python
- Static visualizations (matplotlib + seaborn)
- Interactive dashboard (D3.js)
- Pattern detection and predictive insights

This simulates a real-world security awareness analytics program.

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this lab, I achieved the ability to:

- Design and implement behavior tracking systems for cybersecurity awareness programs
- Analyze behavior change data using Python and statistical techniques
- Generate summary statistics and risk assessments
- Create static and interactive visualizations
- Detect behavioral patterns and high-risk trends
- Generate automated security intervention recommendations
- Build a web-based dashboard to communicate metrics effectively

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before performing this lab, the following knowledge areas were required:

- Basic Python programming (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Understanding of cybersecurity awareness metrics
- Familiarity with CSV-based data structures
- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for dashboard)
- Linux command-line usage
- Virtual environment management (venv)

## 🧠 What This Lab Demonstrates

This lab demonstrates how cybersecurity awareness programs can move from:

❌ Guesswork  
to  
✅ Measurable behavior analytics  

It integrates:

- Knowledge improvement tracking
- Phishing simulation progression
- Password compliance monitoring
- MFA adoption tracking
- Incident reporting behavior
- Risk level classification
- Predictive modeling

---

## 📊 Key Capabilities Implemented

- Behavior score calculation engine
- Risk-level assignment model
- Department-level performance analysis
- Statistical summary generation
- Automated intervention recommendation engine
- Predictive future score modeling
- Interactive executive dashboard

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Modern security programs must justify effectiveness using measurable outcomes.

This lab mirrors real enterprise requirements where security leaders must:

- Prove awareness training ROI
- Identify high-risk users early
- Detect weak departments
- Track phishing resilience
- Improve security culture systematically

Data-driven security awareness is now a board-level expectation.
